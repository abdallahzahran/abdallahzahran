🚀 About Me
🎓 I'm a Computer and Information Systems graduate, specialized in Information Systems, with a passion for Software Engineering and building impactful mobile apps.

📱 My main focus is on Mobile App Development using Flutter, and I'm currently learning Native Android Development with Kotlin.

🎨 I also have a background in Graphic Design, and I’ve studied UI/UX design to support my journey as a developer who not only builds apps, but also understands how they should look and feel. I aim to bring a designer’s eye to my development work, adding creative touches that enhance the user experience.

📊 I'm deeply interested in the data field, and I enjoy exploring topics like data analysis, structuring, and visualization.

🧠 I’m continuously improving my skills in clean architecture, state management, and performance optimization.

✍️ I believe in writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code that delivers real value to users.

💬 Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about Flutter, Dart, Kotlin, UI/UX, or anything data-related.
